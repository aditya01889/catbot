# CatBot Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

CatBot follows a modern, modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability. The system is divided into several key components:

```
catbot/
├── frontend/          # React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
├── backend/           # FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
├── platform/          # Platform-specific code (mobile, extension)
└── docs/             # Project documentation
```

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and follows a feature-based architecture:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Features**: Self-contained feature modules
- **Services**: API clients and service integrations
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI route handlers
- **Services**: Business logic and use cases
- **Models**: Database models and schemas
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
2. **API Communication**: RESTful API with JSON payloads
3. **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
4. **Data Persistence**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)

## Security Considerations

- JWT for authentication
- Environment-based configuration
- Input validation with Pydantic
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (to be implemented)
- CSRF protection (to be implemented)

## Deployment Architecture

- **Frontend**: Hosted on Vercel
- **Backend**: Containerized with Docker, deployed on Render
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Future Considerations

- Microservices architecture for scale
- Real-time features with WebSockets
- Serverless functions for specific features
- CDN for static assets
- Multi-region deployment for global users
